<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
     <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
     <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
       an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
       of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
       the other scientific journals her work had
       appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
       The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
       since college, and the longer she spent in these
       four walls the more she felt she needed to be
       free.</p>
     <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
       sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
       proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
       people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
       many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
       the secrets of the llama <abbr
       title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
       outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
       she had something better to do.</p>
